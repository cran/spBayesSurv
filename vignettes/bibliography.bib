  Abstract                 = {A linear model (i.e. additive hazards model) is suggested for the influence of covariates on the intensity function. This approach is less vulnerable than the Cox model to problems of inconsistency when covariates are deleted or the precision of covariate measurements is changed. A method of non-parametric estimation of regression functions is presented. This results in plots that may give information on the change over time in the influence of covariates. A test method and two goodness of fit plots are also given. The approach is illustrated by simulation as well as by data from a clinical trial of treatment of carcinoma of the oropharynx.}

  Abstract                 = {Recent developments in GIS have encouraged health science databases to incorporate geographical information about the subjects under study. Such databases have in turn generated interest among statisticians to develop and analyze models that account for spatial clustering and variation. In this article we develop a semiparametric (Cox) hierarchical Bayesian frailty model for capturing spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the survival patterns of women diagnosed with breast cancer in Iowa. In the absence of appropriate surrogates for standards of treatments and health care for cancer patients in the different counties, epidemiologists and health-care professionals are interested in discerning spatial patterns in survival from breast cancer that might be present among the counties. In addition, it is naturally of interest to see if the counties show discernible temporal trends over the years. The SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) database from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provides data on a cohort of breast cancer patients observed progressively through time, spanning 26 years. We implement our hierarchical spatio-temporal models on data extracted from the database for the 99 counties of Iowa. Our results suggest log-relative hazards that are generally flat initially, but steadily decrease for more recent years.},

In public health settings, epidemiologists and health-care professionals are interested in discerning spatial patterns in survival data that might exist among the counties. This paper develops a Bayesian hierarchical model for capturing spatial heterogeneity within the framework of proportional odds. This is deemed more appropriate when a substantial percentage of subjects enjoy prolonged survival. We discuss the implementation issues of our models, perform comparisons among competing models and illustrate with data from the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) database of the National Cancer Institute, paying particular attention to the underlying spatial story.}

  Abstract                 = {The use of survival models involving a random effect or 'frailty' term is becoming more common. Usually the random effects are assumed to represent different clusters, and clusters are assumed to be independent. In this paper, we consider random effects corresponding to clusters that are spatially arranged, such as clinical sites or geographical regions. That is, we might suspect that random effects corresponding to strata in closer proximity to each other might also be similar in magnitude. Such spatial arrangement of the strata can be modeled in several ways, but we group these ways into two general settings: geostatistical approaches, where we use the exact geographic locations (e.g. latitude and longitude) of the strata, and lattice approaches, where we use only the positions of the strata relative to each other (e.g. which counties neighbor which others). We compare our approaches in the context of a dataset on infant mortality in Minnesota counties between 1992 and 1996. Our main substantive goal here is to explain the pattern of infant mortality using important covariates (sex, race, birth weight, age of mother, etc.) while accounting for possible (spatially correlated) differences in hazard among the counties. We use the GIS ArcView to map resulting fitted hazard rates, to help search for possible lingering spatial correlation. The DIC criterion (Spiegelhalter et al., Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 2002, to appear) is used to choose among various competing models. We investigate the quality of fit of our chosen model, and compare its results when used to investigate neonatal versus post-neonatal mortality. We also compare use of our time-to-event outcome survival model with the simpler dichotomous outcome logistic model. Finally, we summarize our findings and suggest directions for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {Incorporating spatial variation could potentially enhance information coming from survival data. In addition, simultaneous (joint) modeling of time-to-event data from different diseases, such as cancers, from the same patient could provide useful insights as to how these diseases behave together. This paper proposes Bayesian hierarchical survival models for capturing spatial correlations within the proportional hazards (PH) and proportional odds (PO) frameworks. Parametric (Weibull for the PH and log-logistic for the PO) models were used for the baseline distribution while spatial correlation is introduced in the form of county�cancer-level frailties. We illustrate with data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database of the National Cancer Institute on patients in Iowa diagnosed with multiple gastrointestinal cancers. Model checking and comparison among competing models were performed and some implementation issues were presented. We recommend the use of the spatial PH model for this data set.},

  Abstract                 = {Adopting a unifying, Bayesian perspective, several recent advances in smoothing and semiparametric regression are presented in this book. Simulation-based full Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference and empirical Bayes procedures closely related to penalized likelihood estimation and mixed models are considered here. Throughout, the focus is on semiparametric regression and smoothing based on basis expansions of unknown functions and effects in combination with smoothness priors for the basis coefficients.

Beginning with a review of basic methods for smoothing and mixed models, separate chapters then treat longitudinal data, spatial data and event history data. Worked examples from various fields such as forestry, development economics, medicine and marketing are used to illustrate the statistical methods covered in this book. Most of these examples have been analysed using implementations in the Bayesian software, BayesX, and some with R codes.},

Exploratory analysis suggests both clinically and statistically significant variation in survival rates across the region. A multivariate gamma frailty model incorporating spatial dependence is proposed and applied, with results confirming the dependence of hazard on location.},

  Abstract                 = {Cucurbit downy mildew caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis is economically the most important disease of cucurbits globally, and the pathogen is disseminated aerially over a large spatial scale. Spatio-temporal spread of the disease was characterized during phase I (low and sporadic disease outbreaks) and II (rapid increase in disease outbreaks) of the epidemic using records collected from sentinel plots from 2008 to 2009 in 23 states in the eastern United States as part of the United States Department of Agriculture Cucurbit Downy Mildew ipmPIPE network. A substantive goal of this study was to explain the pattern of time to disease outbreak using important covariates while accounting for spatially correlated differences in risk of disease outbreak among the states. Survival analyses that accounts for spatial dependence were performed on time to disease outbreak, and posterior median frailties (or random effects) were mapped to identify states with high or low risk for disease outbreak. From February to October, disease occurred in 195 and 172 out of 413 and 556 cases monitored in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Disease outbreaks were spatially aggregated, with a spatial dependence of up to 1,025 km where clustering of outbreaks in phase I and II of the epidemic were similar. However, unlike in phase I of the epidemic, space-time point pattern analysis was significant (P < 0.0001) for outbreaks in phase II, during which the highest risk window as estimated by the space-time function was within 1.5 months and 500 km of the initial outbreak. The risk of disease outbreak peaked around July and decreased thereafter until the end of the study period. Spatially correlated analysis of time to disease outbreak indicated the need to incorporate spatial frailties in standard survival analysis models. Evaluation of alternative formulations of the spatial models demonstrated that a Bayesian hierarchical spatially structured frailty model best described time to disease outbreak. This frailty model showed clustering of outbreaks at the state level and indicated that states in the mid-Atlantic region have high spatial frailties and a high risk of downy mildew outbreak.},

Estimation of the copula association parameter is easily implemented with existing software using a two-stage estimation procedure. Using the Gaussian copula, we are able to test whether the association parameter is equal to zero. When the association term is positive, the model can be extended to incorporate cluster-level frailty terms. Asymptotic properties are derived under the two-stage estimation scheme. Simulation studies verify finite sample utility. We apply the method to a Children�s Oncology Group multicenter study of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The analysis estimates marginal treatment effects and examines potential clustering within treatment institution.},

With e-commerce data, a recent question of interest in marketing research has been to describe spatially clustered purchasing behavior and to assess whether geographic distance is the appropriate metric to describe purchasing dependence. We present a model for the dependence structure of time-to-event data subject to spatial dependence to characterize purchasing behavior from the motivating example from e-commerce data. We assume the Farlie�Gumbel�Morgenstern (FGM) distribution and then model the dependence parameter as a function of geographic and demographic pairwise distances. For estimation of the dependence parameters, we present pairwise composite likelihood equations. We prove that the resulting estimators exhibit key properties of consistency and asymptotic normality under certain regularity conditions in the increasing-domain framework of spatial asymptotic theory.},
